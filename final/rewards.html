            <p>At the end of each floor, you have the ability to unlock Trasure Chests, but the kind of chest you are
                able to unlock is based off of your Score. No matter what score you get, you can always unlock the Wood,
                Gold, and Diamond Chests. If you get 230+ Score you can unlock the Emerald Chest. If you get 270+ Score
                you can unlock the Obsidian Chest. If you get 300+ Score you can unlock the Bedrock Chest. But, you can
                only unlock one of these chests per round. As you play through a dungeon, you will get a score based on
                your speed, how many rooms you cleared, how many puzzles you completed, and how many secrets you
                completed. Let’s go through each of those criteria. In order to clear rooms, you just simply have to
                kill every enemy inside that room of the dungeon. As you go through the dungeon, there will be a few
                rooms that are designated Puzzle Rooms. These rooms don't have enemies in them, instead the only goal is
                to complete the puzzle. The puzzles can range from killing certain enemies in order from lowest health
                to highest health, or just playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The last way to get a higher score in the
                dungeon is collecting secrets. Secrets are just little collectables hidden around the dungeon that you
                can collect. They are items laying on the floor you have to pick up, or chests you can open. Each secret
                you collect increases your score. Although the order of rooms in the dungeon is randomized, the location
                of secrets in those rooms is not. For example, one room will have the secrets in the same spot every
                run, but the location of that room won’t be the same in every run. The loot you get from the different
                chests is randomly chosen from a loot table every run, and that loot table is different from each floor.
