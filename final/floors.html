            <h1>The Catacombs</h1>
            <p>As of right now, there is only one type of Dungeons called “The Catacombs”. There are 8 separate floors
                in this dungeon. What this means is that there is essentailly 8 different levels. Each time you play
                through a floor, its layout is randomized using a set of about 47 different rooms. This means that
                almost everytime you play it, it’s a unique experience. Although there are a few things that remain
                constant in each dungeon. First, is the fact that each dungeon has a series of Wither Doors that you
                have to get to in order to reach the Blood Room. The blood room has a mini-boss that you have to beat in
                order to get to the boss at the end of a dungeon. Second, is secrets that you have to collect in order
                to fully complete a dungeon. (More information on secrets <a href="rewards.html"
