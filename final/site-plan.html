      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      Inside Hypixel Skyblock, there is a segment of the game called Dungeons. In this section of the game, you and a
      team of 4 other people go through a procedurally generated dungeon, killing enemies and collecting loot. After
      getting through the dungeon, you get to a boss room. Killing said boss will allow you to open up a loot chest to
      obtain rewards. As you may have noticed above, in order to play dungeons effectively, you need a team of five
      people. As a result, the game developers made an ingame system where you can team up with random players online,
      just in case you don't have enough friends online to play with. This is a very good solution, but also can be
      quite annoying. As a result, sometimes you can get really good teams and breeze through dungeons, and sometimes
      you get teammates that have no idea what they're doing, and complete ruin your attempt. Although, this is less a
      problem with dungeons, and more a problem with online multiplayer games in general. This is why all the good
      players have online communities that they have built with only good players, although this makes it a little
      difficult for someone new to join the dungeons community.

    <h3>Floors</h3>
    <p>
      As of right now, there is only one type of Dungeons called “The Catacombs”. There are 8 separate floors in this
      dungeon. What this means is that there is essentailly 8 different levels. Each time you play through a floor, its
      layout is randomized using a set of about 47 different rooms. This means that almost everytime you play it, it’s a
      unique experience. Although there are a few things that remain constant in each dungeon.

      First, is the fact that each dungeon has a series of Wither Doors that you have to get to in order to reach the
      Blood Room. The blood room has a mini-boss that you have to beat in order to get to the boss at the end of a
      dungeon.

      Second, is secrets that you have to collect in order to fully complete a dungeon. (More information on secrets
      here. (Link this to my other website page))

      The different floors each have their own bosses. The following is just a small list of each floor and their
      respective bosses.
      The Entrance - The Watcher
      Floor 1 - Bonzo
      Floor 2 - Scarf
      Floor 3 - The Professor
      Floor 4 - Thorn
      Floor 5 - Livid
      Floor 6 - Sadan
      Floor 7 - Maxor, Storm, Goldor, and Necron.

    <h3>Rewards</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of each floor, you have the ability to unlock Trasure Chests, but the kind of chest you are able to
      unlock is based off of your Score. No matter what score you get, you can always unlock the Wood, Gold, and Diamond
      Chests. If you get 230+ Score you can unlock the Emerald Chest. If you get 270+ Score you can unlock the Obsidian
      Chest. If you get 300+ Score you can unlock the Bedrock Chest. But, you can only unlock one of these chests per
      round. As you play through a dungeon, you will get a score based on your speed, how many rooms you cleared, how
      many puzzles you completed, and how many secrets you completed. Let’s go through each of those criteria.
      In order to clear rooms, you just simply have to kill every enemy inside that room of the dungeon.
      As you go through the dungeon, there will be a few rooms that are designated Puzzle Rooms. These rooms don't have
      enemies in them, instead the only goal is to complete the puzzle. The puzzles can range from killing certain
      enemies in order from lowest health to highest health, or just playing a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
      The last way to get a higher score in the dungeon is collecting secrets. Secrets are just little collectables
      hidden around the dungeon that you can collect. They are items laying on the floor you have to pick up, or chests
      you can open. Each secret you collect increases your score. Although the order of rooms in the dungeon is
      randomized, the location of secrets in those rooms is not. For example, one room will have the secrets in the same
      spot every run, but the location of that room won’t be the same in every run.

      The loot you get from the different chests is randomly chosen from a loot table every run, and that loot table is
      different from each floor. For more information on what you can get from each floor go to this page from the
      Official Hypixel Skyblock Wiki.
