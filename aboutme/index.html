    <h2>Benjamin Gardner</h2>
    <p>My name is Benjamin Gardner. I am 17 years old and have 3 older siblings, and one younger sibling. I am from Henderson, Nevada. I had lived there my entire life up until I came to BYUI.</p>
    <p>As of right now, I am a Computer Science major, but I'm thinking I want to switch to being a Software Engineering major. The reason I initially chose my major, is because I love computers. I've grown up using them at all times of my life, even being online schooled at home for a few years. I decided that I wanted to do something with computers in the future, when I was in second grade. I was in our GATE program, and as a part of that, they introduced us to programming via Scratch. I immediately fell in love with coding, and have been slowly self-teaching my self ever since.</p>
    <p>One of the things that I love to do in my freetime, is play videogames. I've always had video games around me, because my mom loved to play video games. I played them with my siblings growing up, and have stuck with them ever since.</p>
